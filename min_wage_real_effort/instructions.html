        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        One of you will be selected at random to be <b>Employer</b>; the other will be <b>Worker</b>.
        You will learn whether you are Employer or Worker prior to making any decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Employer is going to hire a Wroker to complete a word encoding task you just saw. To start, 
        Employer will send a wage offer to the Worker and the wage offer is an integer between {{ wage_low }}
        and {{ wage_high }}.
        In the meantime, Worker will be asked to enter their reservation wage between {{ wage_low }} and 
        {{ wage_high }} (i.e. the minimal wage to accept the job offer) for completing the task. Then if 
        Employer's wage offer is greater than the Worker's reservation wage, the computer will automatically 
        help the Worker to accept it; if not, the compupter will automatcally reject it. 
        Then both Employer and Worker will be directed to the word encoding task.

        The Employer is going to hire a Worker to complete a word encoding task you just saw. To start, 
        Employer will send a wage offer to the Worker, Since the government is implementing the Minimum 
        Wage policy now, the wage offer should be an integer between minimum wage {{ min_wage }}
        and {{ wage_high }}.
        In the meantime, Worker will be asked to enter their reservation wage between {{ wage_low }} and 
        {{ wage_high }} (i.e. the minimal wage to accept the job offer) for completing the task. Then if 
        Employer's wage offer is greater than the Worker's reservation wage, the computer will automatically
