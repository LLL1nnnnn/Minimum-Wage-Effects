    In the second task, you will be making choices between two lotteries represented as "Option A" and "Option B". 
    The payoff for "Option A" is always fixed at {{ lottery_a }} points and the payoff for "Option B" can be either 
    {{ lottery_b_hi }} points or {{ lottery_b_lo }} points. 
    Each row of the decision table contains a pair of choices between "Option A" and "Option B".
    You make your choice by clicking on one of the radio buttons to the left of both options. 
    Only one option in each row can be selected, and you may change your decision as you wish. 
    While the payoffs of the two options are fixed for all decisions, the chance of getting the two outcomes for 
    "Option B" varies among the ten decisions. 
</p>
<p>
    Even though you will make ten decisions, only one of these will end up being used. The selection of the one 
    to be used depends on the computer's random number generator. No decision is any more likely to be used than 
    any other, and you will not know in advance which one will be selected, so please think about each one carefully. 
    This random selection of a decision fixes the row (i.e. the Decision) that will be used.
</p>
<p>
    After the Decision row is selected, your payoff depends on the option you chose (A or B). 
    If you chose "Option A", you will get a sure payment of {{ lottery_a }} points; if you chose "Option B", 
    your payoff will be randomly determined according to the corresponding probabilities for {{ lottery_b_hi }} 
    points or {{ lottery_b_lo }} points. 
</p>
<!-- <p>
    To summarize: You will make 10 choices; for each decision you will have to choose between "Option A" and "Option B". 
    You may choose "Option A" for some decision rows and "Option B" for other rows. When you are finished, one of the 
    10 decisions will be randomly picked for your payoff. Then a random pick will determine your payment for the option 
    you chose in that decision.
</p> -->

<p>
    To summarize, you will indicate an option, A or B, for each of the rows by clicking on the "radio buttons" 
    on the left side of the options. 
    Then a random number fixes which row of the table (i.e. which decision) is relevant for your earnings.
    In that row, your decision fixed the choice for that row, Option A or Option B. If you chose Option A, 
    then you get a sure payoff; if you chose Option B, then a final random number will determine the money 
    payoff for the decision you made.
