<p>
    In the following rounds, you will play 20 rounds of sequential search game. 
</p>

<p>
    In each round, you are going to search for a product to purchase. You have an endowment of 100 points at the beginning of each round and you start with no product on your searched list. You can choose to search for the next product at a constant cost <math>c</math> per search. You know that there are two possible qualities for each product, <b>High</b> and <b>Low</b>, and you receive different values associated with different qualitiesï¼Œwhich are <math>v<sub>H</sub></math> and <math>v<sub>L</sub></math>, respectively. High quality products give you a higher value than low quality products, that is <math>v<sub>H</sub> > v<sub>L</sub> > c</math>. Before each search, you will be given the <b>probability distribution</b> for the next product to be high quality. After each search i, you will know the probability of high quality for the product you just searched as <math>p<sub>i</sub></math>. If you decide to purchase that exact product, you will get value <math>v<sub>i</sub> = p<sub>i</sub> v<sub>H</sub> + (1 - p<sub>i</sub>) v<sub>L</sub></math>. You may also purchase any product from your searched list and the value you will receive from that product depends on its own probability of being high quality. If you decide not to purchase any of them, you may keep searching for the next new product at cost <math>c</math>. The round ends when you make a purchase.
</p>

<p>
    Your payoff in each round is calculated directly as <math>&pi;<sub>i</sub> = p<sub>i</sub> v<sub>H</sub> + (1 - p<sub>i</sub>) v<sub>L</sub> - n c</math>, where <math>i</math> is the product you purchase and <math>n</math> is the number of searches you have made.
