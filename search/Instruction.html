    In the first task, you will play {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds of the search game. 
</p>

<p>
    In each round, you are going to search for an item to purchase. You start with no item on your searched list. 
    
    You can choose to search for the next item at a constant cost of <b>{{ search_cost }}</b> points per search 
    by clicking on <b>Search</b> button. 
    
    With the current searched list, you can choose to purchase any item by entering the <b>Search No.</b> of the 
    item that you want to purchse in the box and clicking on the <b>Purchase</b> button; or you may keep searching 
    for the next new item at a cost of <b>{{ search_cost }}</b> points. 
    
    The round ends when you make a purchase. 
</p>


{% if certainty == True %}
    <p>
        For each item, you will receive value of 
        <math>{{ value_high }} points &times; p + {{ value_low }} points &times; (1 - p)</math>, 
        where <math><b>p</b></math> is the probability of getting {{ value_high }} points. 
        
        The items differ in probability of getting {{ value_high }} points. 

        After each search, you will know the <b>probability</b> <math><b>p</b></math> of the item you just searched, 
    </p>

    <p>
        Suppose you have searched <b><math>n</math></b> times in this round, and the item you choose to purchase has 
        <b>Probability of Getting {{ value_high }} points</b> as p, then your payoff in this round is 
        <math><b> - n &times; {{ search_cost }} points + {{ value_high }} points &times; p 
            + {{ value_low }} points &times; (1 - p)</b></math>.

        then your payoff is calculated as <math> - 4 &times; {{ search_cost }} points + {{ value_high }} points &times; 0.75

        For each item, there are two possible outcomes: <b>{{ value_high }}</b> points and <b>{{ value_low }}</b> points. 
        The items differ in probability of getting {{ value_high }} points. 

        After each search, you will know the <b>probability</b> <math><b>p</b></math> of the item you just searched, 
        where <math><b>p</b></math> is the probability of getting {{ value_high }} points. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The value you receive from the item you choose to purchase is either 
        <math>{{ value_high }}</math> points or <math>{{ value_low }}</math> points. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Suppose that you have searched <math>n</math> times in this round, then your payoff in this round is either 
        <math><b>- n &times; {{ search_cost }} points + {{ value_high }} points </b></math> 
        or <math><b>- n &times; {{ search_cost }} points + {{ value_low }} points </b></math>.
