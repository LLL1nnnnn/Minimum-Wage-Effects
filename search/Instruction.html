    In the first task, you will play {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds of the search game. 
</p>

<p>
    In each round, you are going to search for an item to purchase. You start with no item on your searched list. 
    You can choose to search for the next item at a constant cost of <b>{{ search_cost }}</b> points per search 
    by clicking on <b>Search</b> button. 
    For each item, there are two possible outcomes: <b>{{ value_high }}</b> points and 
    <b>{{ value_low }}</b> points. 
    The items differ in probability of getting {{ value_high }} points. 

    After each search, you will know the <b>probability</b> <math><b>p</b></math> of the item you just searched, 
    where <math><b>p</b></math> is the probability of getting {{ value_high }} points. 
</p>

<p>
    With the current searched list, you can choose to purchase any item by entering the <b>Search No.</b> of the 
    item that you want to purchse in the box and clicking on the <b>Purchase</b> button; or you may keep searching 
    for the next new item at cost of <b>{{ search_cost }}</b> points. 
    The round ends when you make a purchase. 
</p>



{% if certainty == True %}
    <p>
        The value you receive from the item you choose to purchase is 
        <math>{{ value_high }} points &times; p + {{ value_low }} points &times; (1 - p)</math>. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Suppose you have searched <b><math>n</math></b> times in this round, your payoff in this round is 
        <math><b> - n &times; {{ search_cost }} points + {{ value_high }} points &times; p 
            + {{ value_low }} points &times; (1 - p)</b></math>. 
    </p>

    {% if value_high == 500 %}
    <p>
        Example. Suppose you have searched 4 times and the item you choose to purchase has 
        <b>Probability of Getting {{ value_high }} points</b> as 0.75 (<math>p = 0.75</math>), 
        then your payoff is calculated as <math> - 4 &times; {{ search_cost }} points + {{ value_high }} points &times; 0.75 
            + {{ value_low }} points &times; (1 - 0.75) = 380</math>. 
    </p>
    {% elif value_high == 200 %}
    <p>
        Example. Suppose you have searched 4 times and the item you choose to purchase has 
        <b>Probability of Getting {{ value_high }} points</b> as 0.75 (<math>p = 0.75</math>), 
        then your payoff is calculated as <math> - 4 &times; {{ search_cost }} points + {{ value_high }} points &times; 0.75 
            + {{ value_low }} points &times; (1 - 0.75) = 155</math>. 
    </p>
    {% endif %}
{% else %}
    <p>
        The value you receive from the item you choose to purchase is either 
        <math>{{ value_high }}</math> points or <math>{{ value_low }}</math> points . 
    </p>

    <p>
        Suppose that you have searched <math>n</math> times in this round, then your payoff in this round is 
        <math><b>- n &times; {{ search_cost }} points + {{ value_high }} points </b></math>

        Example. Suppose you have searched 4 times and the item you choose to purchase has <b>Probability of Getting 
        {{ value_high }} points</b> as 0.75 (<math>p = 0.75</math>), then your payoff could either be 
        <math>- 4 &times; {{ search_cost }} points + {{ value_high }} points = 480 points</math> 
        or <math>- 4 &times; {{ search_cost }} points + {{ value_low }} points = 80 points</math>.
